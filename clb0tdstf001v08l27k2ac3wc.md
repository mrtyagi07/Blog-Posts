# DOM (Document Object Model)

### DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: 

Structured representation of **HTML documents**. Allows javascript to access HTML elements and 
Styles TO **MANIPULATE** them.
 
What does the word MANIPULATE mean?
*Change text, HTML attributes, and even CSS styles*

Here's the code for us to look at:

Let's take a look at the HTML code and compare them to the corresponding DOM elements.

For example,
The DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document.

> It's worth noting that DOM is not a part of the Javascript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.

- This allows us to use JavaScript to interact with the browsers.
- We can write JavaScript to create, modify and delete HTML elements; set styles, classes, and attributes; and listen and respond to events.
- The DOM API is a very complex and extensive API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree.
 Examples: * .querySelector() / .addEventListener() / .createElement() / .innerHTML / .textContent / .children / etc*

**Let's take simple examples to help better understand how this works. Play with this code and see what's written on the screen.**
